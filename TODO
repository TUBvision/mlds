--- TODO ----

- check that minimum requirements are installed (R with MLDS package)

- generate instructions for the use of multithread 
(with snow package in R)

- make implementation cleaner, use rpy2 instead of passing
R commands with subprocess.

- improve documentation, add docstrings to all functions

- eventually implement the class so it does not depend on R. 
For that, one would have to use a GLM solver in python (statmodels?)
